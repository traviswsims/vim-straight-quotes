*straight-quotes.txt*      straight-quotes


This plugin causes all curly quotes to be highlighted in red.


                                                *FixQuotes*

To fix the curly quote errors, just call :FixQuotes.  By default it
operates on the entire file.  Pass a range (or use V to select some lines)
to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.
